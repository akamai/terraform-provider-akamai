# akamai_property_variables


The `akamai_property_variables` allows you to implement dynamic functionality. You can perform conditional logic based on the variable’s value, and catch any unforeseen errors that execute on the edge at runtime.

Typical uses for variables include:

* Simplify configurations by reducing the number of rules and behaviors.
* Improve self serviceability by replacing or extending advanced metadata.
* Automate redirects, forward path rewrites, HTTP header and cookie manipulation.
* Move origin functionality to the edge.


## Example Usage

Basic usage:

```hcl
resource "akamai_property_variables" "origin" {
  variables {
     variable {
        name        = "PMUSER_ORIGIN"
        value       = "origin.example.org"
        description = "Origin Hostname"
        hidden      = true
        sensitive   = true
     }
  }
}
```
