// Wrapper to intercept the papi.Mock's call of t.FailNow(). The Terraform test driver runs the provider code on
// goroutines other than the one created for the test. When t.FailNow() is called from any other goroutine, it causes
// the test to hang because the TF test driver is still waiting to serve requests. Mockery's failure message neglects to
// inform the user which test had failed. Use this struct to wrap a *testing.T when you call mock.Test(T{t}) and the
// mock's failure will print the failling test's name. Such failures are usually caused by the provider invoking an
// unexpected call on the mock.
//
// NB: You should only need to use this where your test uses the Terraform test driver
type T struct{ *testing.T }

// Overrides testing.T.FailNow() so when a test mock fails an assertion, we see which test had failed before it hangs
