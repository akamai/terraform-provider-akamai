# Akamai Terraform Provider: 1.0 Migration guide
Version 1.0.0 of the Akamai provider for Terraform is a major release and includes changes that you will need to consider when upgrading. This guide is intended to help with that process and focuses only on changes from version 0.X to version 1.0.0. 

!> There are several breaking changes documented under [Required Changes](#required-changes) below. The following objects all had major changes akamai_property, akamai_property_variables, akamai_property_rules, akamai_property_activation

~> Version 1.0.0 and later of the Akamai Provider can only be automatically installed on Terraform 0.12 and later.

# Required Changes
## resource `akamai_property_activation`
* The following fields are no longer supported (activate, edge_hostname(comp), version(comp)). 
### Field Renaming
* Rename the following fields property->property_id.  

## datasource `akamai_property_rules`
!> This datasource was repurposed as an actual datasource rather than as a formatting tool.  See documentation on [`akamai_property_rules_template` datasource](../data-sources/property_rules_template.md) for the new JSON templating tool compatible with PMCLI and other Provisioning tools.
* Before upgrading pull your property rules json from state and save to a file to use with the new json templating system.  Just be sure to replace injected variables with their variable references so variable expansion will work when you switch to the new json templating.
* The datasource named `akamai_property_rules` now reads ruletree data instead of formatting rules data from terraform elements. 

## resource `akamai_property_variables`
* This resource was dropped in favor of managing variable as part of a rule tree. 
* See [migrate cpcode](#migrating-property-variables) section below for migration instructions.

## resource `akamai_cp_code`
* Previously this resource would auto import on create of an existing name but now requires explicit import to manage an existing cpcode.
### Field Renaming
* Rename the following fields contract->contract_id, group->group_id, product->product_id 
### Create and Import Changes
* Import requires compound id composed like the following "cpcode_id,contract_id,group_id".  

## resource `akamai_edge_hostname`
* IPV4 and IPV6 fields removed in favor of directly setting ip_behavior to desired value see [`akamai_edge_hostname` resource documentation](../resources/property_edge_hostname.md). Allowed values include : `IPV4` for IP version 4 only, `IPV6_PERFORMANCE` for IP version 6 only, or `IPV6_COMPLIANCE` for both 4 and 6. The default value is `IPV4`. 
### Field Renaming
* Rename the following fields contract->contract_id, group->group_id, product->product_id.  
### Create and Import Changes
* Import requires compound id string composed like the following "edgehostname_id,contract_id,group_id".
* Previously this resource would auto import on conflict but now requires an explicit import to manage an existing config.

## resource `akamai_property`
* Previously this resource would auto import on conflicting name but now requires explicit import to manage an existing property.
The following fields were dropped and each have different migration instructions:
    * `account` - dropped as unused
    * `contact` - dropped as unused.
    * `cpcode` - See [migrate cpcode](#migrating-property-cpcode) section below
    * `is_secure` - See [migrate is_secure](#migrating-property-is_secure) section below
    * `origin` - instead add origin as a behavior in json on top level rule. See [migrate origin](#migrating-property-origin) section below
    * `variables` - See [migrate cpcode](#migrating-property-variables) section below
    * `edge_hostname` - computed field - dropped as unused
    * `version` - computed field.  Renamed latest_version  
### Field Renaming
* Rename the following fields contract->contract_id, group->group_id, product->product_id. 
### Create and Import Changes
* Can import using either property id or the following alternative import strings to clarify context "property_id,contract_id,group_id" 
* Previously this resource would auto import on conflict but now requires an explicit import to manage an existing config.

### Migrating property cpcode
This used to be managed as an attribute on property but it would just overwrite elements in your rule tree potentially causing unneeded updates..

Where before you might have a section like the following :
```
resource "akamai_property" "example_rs" {
    … snipped for brevity ...
    cpcode = 1234
}
```
You will now have a cpcode behavior in your ruletree configuration.  Preferably used in you json template with [`akamai_property_rules_template` datasource](../data-sources/property_rules_template.md) so that you can still resolve terraform variables:
```
{
    "rules": {
        "name": "default",
        "behaviors": [
            {
                "name": "cpCode",
                "options": {
                    "value": {
                       "id": 1234
                    }
                }
            }
        ],
        "children": []
    }
}
```
See additional documentation on [Property cpcode](https://developer.akamai.com/api/core_features/property_manager/vlatest.html#cpcode)
### Migrating property is_secure
This used to be managed as an attribute on property but it would just overwrite elements in your rule tree potentially causing unneeded updates..

Where before you might have a section like the following :

```
resource "akamai_property" "example_rs" {
    … snipped for brevity ...
    is_secure = true
}
```
You will now have an origin behavior in your ruletree template as shown below:
```
{
   "rules": {
       "name": "default",
       "children": [],
       "behaviors": [],
       "options": {
          "is_secure": true
       },
       "comments": "The behaviors in the Default Rule apply to all requests for the property hostname(s) unless another rule overrides the Default Rule settings."
   }
}
```
See additional documentation on [Property rule basic structure](https://developer.akamai.com/api/core_features/property_manager/v1.html#ruletrees)

### Migrating property origin
This used to be managed as an attribute on property but it would just overwrite elements in your rule tree potentially causing unneeded updates..

Where before you might have a section like the following :

```
resource "akamai_property" "example_rs" {
    … snipped for brevity ...
    origin = {
        hostname = var.origin_hostname
        port = 80
        compress = true
        enable_true_client_ip = true
    }
}
```
You will now have a origin attribute in your ruletree configuration.  Preferably used in you json template with [`akamai_property_rules_template` datasource](../data-sources/property_rules_template.md) so that you can still resolve terraform variables like var.origin_hostname below:

```
{
    "rules": {
        "name": "default",
        "behaviors": [
            {
                "name": "origin",
                "options": {
                    "compress": true,
                    "enableTrueClientIp": true,
                    "hostname": var.origin_hostname,
                    "httpPort": 80,
                }
            }
        ],
        "children": []
    }
}
```
See additional documentation on [Property origin](https://developer.akamai.com/api/core_features/property_manager/vlatest.html#origin)

### Migrating property variables
Variables used to have a datasource that took Terraform blocks and formatted them as json for use in a rules tree.  This has been removed in favor of allowing direct control over variables by managing the ruletree as json bringing us in line with other Akamai tools.

Where before you might have a resource defined like the following :

```
resource "akamai_property_variables" "origin" { 
   variables { 
      variable { 
         name = "PMUSER_ORIGIN" 
         value = var.origin 
         description = "Origin Hostname" 
         hidden = true 
         sensitive = true
      }
   }
}
```
You will now have a variable attribute in your ruletree configuration.  Preferably used in you json template with [`akamai_property_rules_template` datasource](../data-sources/property_rules_template.md) so that you can still resolve terraform variables like var.origin below:
```
{
    "rules": {
        "name": "default",
        "variables": [
            {
                "name": "PMUSER_ORIGIN",
                "value": var.origin,
                "description": "Origin Hostname.",
                "hidden": true,
                "sensitive": true
            }
        ],
        "behaviors": [],
        "children": []
    }
}
```
See documentation on [Property variables](https://developer.akamai.com/api/core_features/property_manager/v1.html#declareavariable)
