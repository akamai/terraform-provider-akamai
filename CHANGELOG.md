## 1.0.0 (Dec 9, 2020) Provisioning redesign

#### BREAKING CHANGES:
* provider: configuring via an inline provider block (`property`, `dns`, or `gtm`) has been replaced with a more general `config` block that works the same way.
* There are several breaking changes in the 1.0 release.  You should consult the [Migration guide](docs/guides/1.0_migration.md) for details.
  * resources/akamai_property_activation no longer supports the following fields : activate.  version has gone from being optional to being a required field.
  * data-sources/akamai_property_rules removed in favor of using template JSON object to better work with other Akamai tools and documentation that is all JSON based.
  * resources/akamai_property_variables removed in favor of directly managing the variable segment as part of ruletree object.
  * resources/akamai_cp_code no longer auto-imports on create. If a conflict is detected will error out and to ignore simply import the resource.
  * resources/akamai_edge_hostname no longer supports the following fields : ipv4, ipv6. The revised resource allows setting ip_behavior directly.
  * resources/akamai_property no longer supports the following fields : cp_code, origin, variables, is_secure, contact. The revised resource simplifies the object structure and removes the ability to set the same value more than one way.
#### NOTES:
* provider/papi: changed attribute names in Provisioning to distinguish objects and names from id attributes.  In prior releases, "group" could represent a name, an id, or sometimes both. This release distinguishes them with distinct attribute names "group_name", "group_id" instead of "group"."
#### KNOWN BUGS:
* resources/akamai_property removing hostnames attribute can result in repeated noop update calls because in this case removal means the hostname relationships are un-managed leaving the attribute as empty is a better way to express this change.
#### FEATURES:
* data-sources/akamai_properties added to list properties accessible to the user.
* data-sources/akamai_property_contracts added to list contracts accessible to the user.
* data-sources/akamai_property_groups added to list groups accessible to the user.
* data-sources/akamai_property_products added to list products associated with a given contract.
* data-sources/akamai_property_rule_formats added to list rule_formats.
* data-sources/akamai_property_rules changed to output the structure of a particular rule version on the server. NOTE: this is NOT the same as the deprecated datasource used for rule formatting.
* data-sources/akamai_rules_template added to handle file based JSON templating for rules tree data management
#### ENHANCEMENTS:
* resources/akamai_property_activation aliased property to property_id. Returns these additional attributes : target_version, warnings, errors, activation_id, and status
#### BUG FIXES:
* provider: provider configuration validation requires an edgerc file configured and present even when environment variable-based configuration was used.
* provider: provider inline configuration support was re-introduced as a new config field.
* resources/akamai_property_activation activating and destroying activation for the same property multiple times in a row would fail on second destroy attempt and subsequent destroy attempts with "resource not found error" message.
* resources/akamai_property_activation wrong activation id read for property versions that had been activated and deactivated multiple time.
#### MINOR CHANGES:
* resources/akamai_property aliased property to property_id. contract to contract_id, and product to product_id and account to account_id.  Renamed version to latest_version.
* data-sources/akamai_contract aliased group to group_id and/or group_name.
* data-sources/akamai_cp_code aliased group to group_id and contract to contract_id.
* data-sources/akamai_group aliased name to group_name and contract to contract_id.

## 0.11.0 (Nov 19,2020)

#### NOTES:
* provider: Added support for application security API

    * Re-enabled global account switch key support in edgerc files for reseller accounts.
    * PAPI - edgehostname updated returns - The System could not find cnameTo value

## 0.10.2 (Oct 22,2020)
#### NOTES:
* Documentation formatting
#### KNOWN BUGS:
* provider: provider configuration validation requires an edgerc file configured and present even when environment variable-based configuration was used.
* provider: support for configuring the provider via an inline provider block (`property`, `dns`, or `gtm`) no longer works.  Users should use edgerc file or Terraform environment args to configure instead.

## 0.10.1 (Not released)

## 0.10.0 (Oct 20,2020)

#### NOTES:
* provider: The backing edgegrid library was entirely rewritten.  Provider behavior should be preserved but there is chance of incidental changes due to the project size.
* resources/akamai_edge_hostname: edge_hostname field should be provided with an ending of edgesuite.net, edgekey.net, or akamaized.net.  If a required suffix is not provided then edgesuite.net is appended as default.
#### KNOWN BUGS:
* provider: provider configuration validation requires an edgerc file configured and present even when one should not be needed.
* provider: support for configuring the provider via an inline provider block (`property`, `dns`, or `gtm`) no longer works.  Users should use edgerc file or Terraform environment args to configure instead.
#### ENHANCEMENTS:
* provider: improved error handling and improved message consistency
* provider: release notes categorize updates according to Terraform best practices guide.

## 0.9.1 (Sept 02, 2020)
#### BREAKING CHANGES:
* [IMPORTANT] Dropped support for TF clients <= 0.11. Provider now built using Terraform sdk v2 library. Terraform dropped 0.11 client support as part of this update.  This change will make many new enhancements possible. ([See: Terraform v2 sdk](https://www.terraform.io/docs/extend/guides/v2-upgrade-guide.html))
* resources/akamai_group: contract field (previously optional) now required to ensure contract and group agreement.

#### NOTES:
* [CHANGE] Individual edgerc file sections for different Akamai APIs (i.e., `property_section`, `dns_section`) has been deprecated in favor a common `config_section` used in conjuction with provider aliases ([See: Multiple Provider Configurations](https://www.terraform.io/docs/configuration/providers.html#alias-multiple-provider-configurations))

#### KNOWN BUGS:
* provider: provider configuration validation requires an edgerc file configured and present even when one should not be needed.
* provider: support for configuring the provider via an inline provider block (`property`, `dns`, or `gtm`) no longer works.  Users should use edgerc file or Terraform environment args to configure instead.

#### BUG FIXES:
* [FIX] datasource akamai_group will no longer panic when contract not provided
* [ADD] Project re-organized to prepare for additional APIs to be included
* Fixed build job to compile sub-modules. Code is identical to 0.9.0 release
